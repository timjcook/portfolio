            I am a regular attender of the meetups held by the Ruby community. I'm always looking for any chance to hear what others are doing with similar technology and it is a fantastic to do that through the talks and shared meals.

            I have spent the last 3 years as a resident of the Inspire9 co-working space, one of those as a full time resident. Co-working has had a large influence on my development as a Software Engineer, from sharing my own successes and problems I have with my own projects to the inspiration of hearing the exciting projects that others are undertaking being part of a co-working space and Inspire9 in particular has really help me decide that being a Developer is a worthwhile and satisfying career pursuit.

            I value the contributions to public knowledge bases and software projects that others have made. As I've developed my skills I have and continue to look for ways to give back to this community.
